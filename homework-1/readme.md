### Websites vs Web Applications

_Websites are primarily designed to provide information, with minimal user interaction, and focus on delivering static content. In contrast, web applications are dynamic and user-driven, offering extensive interaction and performing specific tasks or functions for users. While websites are generally simpler in design and functionality, web applications incorporate advanced features and back-end processes to provide interactive and functional experiences._

These extensions can range from language support and linters to themes and integrations with external services like GitHub.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

_**Version control** is a system that tracks changes to files and allows multiple people to collaborate on projects by keeping a history of modifications. **Git** is a distributed version control system that lets developers manage and track changes in their codebase efficiently, facilitating collaboration and ensuring code integrity. **GitHub** is a platform built around Git that provides a web-based interface for managing Git repositories, along with additional features like issue tracking, project management, and collaboration tools._

### Markdown & Documentation

**Markdown** _is a lightweight markup language used to format text using a simple syntax, making it ideal for creating readable documents like README files, wikis, and technical documentation. It supports formatting options such as headings, lists, links, images, and code blocks. **Documentation** is the written text or instructions accompanying software, APIs, and other technology products, providing essential information on functionality, usage, and configuration._
