One take away I learned was arrays and loops are particularly useful in efficiently handling collections of elements, such as applying changes to multiple elements at once. The scores pages I would say was the hardest for me to make. I need remember what .getElementById, .createElement, .appendChild, and .toFixed all do because I was not including some and it was giving me erros.
