## Field Trip Project

Jose Medina

### Project Summary

This website will showcase the Connected by Water art pieces from the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art. The project aims to highlight the historical and cultural significance of water in Indigenous traditions, emphasizing its role in storytelling, identity, and sustainability. I chose this topic because water is a universal element that connects all people, and Indigenous perspectives offer profound insights into its importance.

### Core Webpages

Home Page – Introduces the project and provides an overview of the significance of water in Indigenous cultures.

Artifact Showcase – Displays selected artworks from the Connected by Water collection, with descriptions of their meaning and historical context.

Interactive Timeline – Allows users to explore how Indigenous communities have historically interacted with water through art, rituals, and daily life.

Multimedia Gallery – Features videos, artist interviews, and audio narratives explaining the themes behind the artworks.

Engagement Hub – Includes quizzes, discussion forums, and user-submitted reflections on their own connections to water.

### Design Choices

Reference Websites: The Smithsonian’s Native American Art collection and the Eiteljorg Museum’s official site will serve as inspiration.

Color Palette: Shades of blue and turquoise to represent water, earthy tones to reflect nature, and white for clarity and readability.

Data Structure: The website will use a relational database to store artifact details, artist information, and user interactions. JSON will be used for dynamic content like timelines and multimedia elements.
