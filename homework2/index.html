            <p class="description">The first movie I want to talk about is The Strangers (2008). I heard that a remake
                of
                this movie came out last year and I had never seen the the original. So this weekend I gave it a watch
                and I
                thought the movie was very good it had me on the edge of my seat. The movie was very suspenseful and
                after
                the movie I was scared of every sound I heard downstairs.</p>

                Surf's Up came out in 2007 and I remember as a kid the movie did not intrest me so I did not watch it as
                a kid. So last year I started seeing clips of the movie on Tik Tok so it pushed me to finaly watch the
                moive. I also really liked this movie I thought the animation was very good which helped the movie stand
                out. My favourite Characters was Chicken Joe so I was happy to see him take the win at the end.

                This is a random movie that my girlfriend said we where watching and I can't say no so this is my
                thoughts on the movie. This movie came out in 2004 so it had that early 2000s charm. the main leads of
                the movie where Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. I had a fun time with movie but I did think it was a bit
                too long.

                I saw this movie this weekend I thought that the movie was over all alright. The movie got a lot of hate
                for may reasons and this movie also went though a lot of reshoots. My favourite part of the movie was
                the ending battle because they showed the red hulk.
