## Assignment 3: Choose Your Adventure Story

### Story Summary

My story is about waking up hungry and deciding how you are going to get food.

### Key Takeaways

I learned how to use DOM manipulation to dynamically update content on the webpage, ensuring the userâ€™s choices directly influence what they see. I understand that functions and conditional logic play a big role in driving the story, allowing for multiple paths and outcomes. Using confirm and prompt adds interactivity, while custom buttons enhance the user experience by letting them make decisions in real time. Another important takeaway is the need to maintain clear and consistent function names to avoid errors and confusion in the code. Lastly, I see how helpful it is to plan the story structure before coding, so all decisions and their impacts are logically connected and easy to follow.
